  "content": "The Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom of the Blessed Lady\nBhagavatī Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya\nIn the Tibetan language: The Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom of the Blessed Lady\nFirst Fascicle\nI prostrate to the Blessed Mother Prajñāpāramitā.\nThus I have heard at one time.\nThe Blessed One was dwelling on Vulture Peak Mountain in Rājagṛha, together with a great assembly of monks and a great assembly of bodhisattvas.\nAt that time, the Blessed One entered into the samādhi of the Dharma discourse called 'Profound Illumination.'\nAt that time, the noble Bodhisattva Mahasattva Avalokiteśvara was thoroughly contemplating the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom that which transcends conceptual understanding and ordinary causality with direct, non-conceptual awareness.\nOne should view those five aggregates as empty of inherent nature.\nThen, through the power of the Buddha, the venerable Śāriputra spoke these words to the noble great bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara.\nSon of noble family, whoever wishes to practice the profound Perfection of Wisdom, how should they train in meditation? Having thus spoken, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Noble Avalokiteshvara said these words to the venerable Shariputra: O Shariputra, any son of noble family or daughter of noble family who wishes to engage in the profound Perfection of Wisdom should view things in this way: they should correctly and thoroughly observe the five aggregates as empty of inherent nature.\nForm is empty. Emptiness manifests as form.\nForm is not other than emptiness;<br>emptiness is not other than form.\nSimilarly, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness are empty.\nTherefore, Shariputra, all phenomena are emptiness; without characteristics, unborn, unceased, stainless, not free from stains, not diminished, not filled.<br><br>Therefore, Shariputra, in emptiness—that ultimate nature of reality—there is no form, no feeling, no perception, no mental formations, no consciousness; no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind; no visible form, no sound, no smell, no taste, no tangible object, no mental phenomena.\nThere is no eye element, and from there up to the mind element there is none; likewise, there is no dharma element and no mental consciousness element.\nThere is neither inherently existing ignorance nor cessation of ignorance, up through neither aging-and-death nor cessation of aging-and-death.<br><br>Neither suffering, origin, cessation, nor path exist as such.<br><br>There is neither wisdom to grasp, nor attainment to achieve, nor even non-attainment.\nTherefore, Shariputra, because there is nothing to attain, bodhisattvas rely on and abide in the Perfection of Wisdom.\nSince the mind is intrinsically free from obscurations that have never truly existed, there is no fear; having completely transcended misconceptions about ultimate existence through the progressive stages of the path up to vajra-like concentration, one reaches the culmination of nirvāṇa—the perfect state of buddhahood that transcends all expression and thought.\nAll buddhas established throughout the three times, by relying on the Perfection of Wisdom, have fully awakened to unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment.\nTherefore, the Perfection of Wisdom mantra, the great vidyā mantra, the unsurpassed mantra, the mantra equal to the unequaled, the mantra that thoroughly pacifies all suffering. Because it is not false, it should be known as true.\nThus: Gone, gone, gone beyond, thoroughly gone beyond, enlightenment, svaha!\nThus, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva, a great being, should train in the profound perfection of wisdom.\nThen the Blessed One arose from that samādhi. Having bestowed praise upon the noble Avalokiteśvara, the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva, saying: 'Excellent, excellent! Son of noble family, it is exactly so.'\nThus it is, son of noble family, one should practice the profound Perfection of Wisdom in exactly the way that has been taught.\nAfter the Blessed One <span class=\\text-quotation-style\\>Bhagavān</span> had thus spoken,\nThe Venerable Śāradvatīputra, and the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, and the entire assembly, and the world including gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and openly praised what the Blessed One had spoken.\nThus concludes the Noble Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom.\n",
